        <p  class="texte"> My name is Tago brice Junior, I am Ivorian and I live in France since September 2019.
            After my Baccalaureate, I was lucky enough to get a scholarship that allowed me to 
            to continue my studies in France. After two years of preparatory class, I was able to integrate 
            the computer science department of ENSEIRB-MATMECA, a digital engineering school. Passionate about computer science
            I like to learn and discover new technologies. This porfolio that I realized is like a showcase 
            in which I will expose my career, my skills, my main projects.
