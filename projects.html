            <h1> Sandwich </h1>
            <p class="majeur"> Sandwich is an academic project in pair realized in C language . 
                The objective was to simulate the behavior of cellular automata.
                We had to create cells, rules governing their evolution 
                and also set up a management system for these cells in this world.
                A concrete example of cell evolution in a world is the game of life by 
                John Conway's Game of Life. This project allowed me not only to become more comfortable in the use of 
                C language, but also to discover and use programming tools such as GIT or the Makefile;
                programming techniques such as separate compilation.
                It also has a pretext of introduction to SDL which allowed me to use a graphical interface.

            <h1> Data compression by Huffman </h1>
            <p  class="majeur">Within the framework of the course of theory of information, I had to write the algorithm
                of coding by Huffman. I was able to realize the performances of this method by realizing a series of tests on several files (text, image) and by comparing the
                on several files (text, image) and by comparing the results obtained with those of other modes of compression 
                data compression. I could also realize the limits of this method, the conditions making its use 
                optimal. This project was for me to practice the python language, to gain ease in the use of
                use of libraries such as matplotlib, numpy, openCv; to gain dexterity in handling, visualizing 
                manipulation, data visualization and results analysis.

            <h1> CodeXp </h1>
            <p  class="majeur"> CodeXp is a personal project that is still in progress. It will be realized with the 
                framework react Native. It is an application that like Wordbit will allow to learn 
                a little more about a language at each unlocking of our phone and thus to ganger in Xp 
                in a language that we will have chosen in a passive way. I also analyze the possibility
                to ask the user to write simple programs about what he will have learned beforehand. 
                previously. This will be my first large scale personal project.</p>
